# Project_3
Airbnb project

Our group was interested in creating an interactive map which hosts recent Airbnb data. We used SQL, SQL Alchemy, Python, Pandas, Plotly, Flask, Geojson data, Javascript, Openstreetmap, Leaflet, Particles, HTML, and CSS.

Our dashboard includes many interactive user features. The map shows San Francisco and all of the available homes in san francisco. The different color markers pin point the pricing. Green is for homes less than $100 a night, blue is $100-$200, yellow is $200-$300 and red $300+ a night. When you select a certain home, a pop-up will appear with details about the posting and a link to reserve specific dates through the Airbnb portal. 

As a user moves the curser around the map, the specific neighborhood under the curser will highlight. When a certain neighborhood is selected, the map will zoom and re-center around the selected neighborhood. This is made possible with a geojson library of multipolygons for each neighborhood. 

Our dashboard also holds 3 vertical bar charts. One of the bar charts shows the amount of homes avaiable in each neighborhood, another shows the average price per home in each neighborhood, another shows the average customer star rating in each neighborhood.

Lastly, our particles background moves with the cursor.

We did run into various difficulities, however it was nothing asking for help and google could not solve.
